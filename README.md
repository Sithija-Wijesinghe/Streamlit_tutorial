# Cars Data Analysis and Price Prediction Web App

This is a Streamlit web application designed to evaluate a car dataset, show key statistics, and forecast car pricing according to engine capacity (CC). The software makes predictions using linear regression and a variety of data visualization approaches.

## Features

1. **Tabular Data Display**: View the first 150 rows of the dataset.
2. **Statistical Summary**: Get a statistical summary of the entire dataset.
3. **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualize the correlation between different numeric columns in the dataset.
4. **Graphs**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: Plot vehicle names against engine capacity (CC) with different categories.
   - **Bar Graph**: Plot the index of the dataset against vehicle types.
   - **Histogram**: View the distribution of vehicle types.
5. **Price Prediction**: Predict the minimum price of a vehicle based on its engine capacity using **Linear Regression**.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

Name: Name of the vehicle
Type: Vehicle type (e.g., Sedan, SUV)
CC: Engine capacity of the vehicle in cubic centimeters (CC)
Min Price (Lakh): Minimum price of the vehicle in lakhs
